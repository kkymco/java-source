// An Env is an interface used by the leveldb implementation to access
// operating system functionality like the filesystem etc.  Callers
// may wish to provide a custom Env object when opening a database to
// get fine gain control; e.g., to rate limit file system operations.
//
// All Env implementations are safe for concurrent access from
// multiple threads without any external synchronization.
